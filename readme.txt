Thank you for the opportunity to complete this task for the Interactive Web Designer position.

Custom Post Type = Impacts, Reasons, Testimonials
ACF = Number (in Impacts)

 NOTES:
 - There were a few items that made this particular build a little harder. In my experience a developer will get PSDs to work from that contain specific fonts, positions, assets, etc. but this was give in three JPGs files (and may be common place at Blackbaud but wanted to point out this made the task more challenging), which makes the extractment of data such as fonts, opacity, etc. much more difficult. Fonts were the main issue as you cannot specifically identify which font you are suppoed to use since it is not part of a PSD in which you can find this information. Also with fonts you are unable to correctly identify the size of all fonts. Attempting to measure in Photoshop does not work and pixel measurement does not accurately translate into font sizes. Therefore, I had to use my best judgement based on developer tools in Firefox such as PerfectPixel to attempt an exact match. 

 - The 'numbers' given in the Impacts section did not match up to any font given. There was a slight difference, specifically you can easily identify this on the nubmer '1'. It would not match up with the given fonts.

 - Calibri font is not offered via google fonts 

 - Transitions were a best guess with the sizes given in the screenshots. Again without a more specific design given in either PSD or prototypes built along with funcationality noes of what should occur. I had to make a best judgement call on some transition.

 - In the Medium view the Blog post section presented "wonky" with the text aligning completely to the left where the image contained padding. I would want to discuss with the client/designer and suggeest a better design decision for a better user experience, making the text the same alignment as the image as well as add padding between the two.

 - In the footer, specifically in the mobile display, all elements are aligned Left. This is another area to note that for consistently I would suggest moving the Search tool and Social Icons also to the left. 

 - Also in the Mobile display, I know you stated not to worry about a Menu dropdown but I wanted to go an extra step - hope you don't mind - and provide a collapse feature to present a funcationally working mobile menu.

- Mispelling of Website - in jpg mobile screenshot it is spelled "Wedbsite" > Was corrected

- I based my media queries on the size of the screenshots

- There are other areas of the design I would have made suggestions of slight changes for a better look and user feel such as input field sizes, paddings, margins, transitions, etc. but I developed according to what was given. Please note that I would have made these updates but the unknown processes of allowing the developer flexibility to make these decisions I stayed true to the design provided.
